  # Description
  <p>As an individual who uses too many stick notes, I wanted to design a digital tool that would allow anyone to write and save notes. This way the user can organize thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be done. When a user launches the note taker, they are presented with a landing page and a link to a notes page. Once the user has navigated to the notes page then they are presented with the opportunity to enter a note title and text. The save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page and they can save the note. The user can revist notes that they have created in the past or delete them.</p>

  # Installation
